#Football Scores
## Project 3 of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree (Part 1 of 2)

This app shows scores for football (soccer) across many leagues.  The data is pulled from http://api.football-data.org/

In this project, I diagnosed problems in the existing app based on user feedback and added enhancements in order to make it production ready. The work included ensuring errors were handled gracefully, building a widget (collection) for the home screen, support for screen readers, optimizations for localization, 

and barcode scanning via a library.
